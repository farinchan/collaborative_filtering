## Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items to users based on their preferences and characteristics. It analyzes the content of items and matches them with the user's profile or previous interactions. This approach is useful when there is enough information about the items and users' preferences.

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items to users based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users. It relies on the idea that users who have similar tastes and preferences in the past will have similar tastes in the future. Collaborative filtering can be further divided into two types: user-based and item-based.
